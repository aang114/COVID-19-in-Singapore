12th Feb 2020

                 Six more confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospital today. In all, 15 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital.
   2.             As of 12 February 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified three additional cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore.
   Links between previous cases found
   3.             Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.
   a) Cases 8 and 9, as well as Cases 31, 33 and 38, are linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road). This is a possible cluster involving five cases (Cases 8, 9, 31, 33 and 38).
   b) Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34 and 40) are linked to the cluster associated with Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road).
   c) Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to the private business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22 January.
   d) Two of the confirmed cases (Cases 42 and 47) are linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.
   e) Two of the confirmed cases (Cases 48 and 49) are linked to the Grace Assembly of God.
   Investigations on these clusters are ongoing.
   4.             Contact tracing is underway for the other eight locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China. Case 44 was a contact of Cases 13 and 26.
   About the confirmed cases
   Case 48
   5.             Case 48 is a 34 year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to China but was in Malaysia on 26 January 2020. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).
   6.             He reported onset of symptoms on 1 February, and had sought treatment at three general practitioner (GP) clinics on 2 February, 4 February, 7 February and 9 February, as well as a medical clinic for X-ray on 10 February. He went to NCID on 10 February, and was subsequently confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 11 February afternoon.
   7.             Prior to hospital admission, he had visited Plaza Singapura (68 Orchard Road), Star Vista (1 Vista Exchange Green) and Fusionopolis (1 Fusionopolis Place). He also went to work at Grace Assembly of God (Tanglin) (355 Tanglin Road) and Grace Assembly of God (Bukit Batok) (1 Bukit Batok West Avenue 4). He stays at Bukit Batok Street 25.
   Case 49
   8.             Case 49 is a 46 year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to China. He is currently warded in an isolation room at National University Hospital (NUH).
   9.             He reported onset of symptoms on 3 February, and sought treatment at a GP clinic on 8 February. He went to the emergency department at NUH on 8 February and was discharged on the same day. He was admitted to NUH on 10 February. Subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 11 February afternoon.
   10.             Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at Grace Assembly of God (Tanglin) and Grace Assembly of God (Bukit Batok). He stays at Toh Guan Road.
   Case 50
   11.             Case 50 is a 62 year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to China. He is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. Prior to hospital admission, he went to work at DBS Asia Central at Marina Bay Financial Centre (12 Marina Boulevard). He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 12 February morning.
   12.             MOH has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the case.
   Update on condition of confirmed cases
   13.             To date, a total of 15 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Of the 35 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving. Eight are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.
   Update on suspect cases
   14.             As of 12 February 2020, 12pm, 638 of the suspect cases have tested negative for COVID-19, and 50 have tested positive. Test results for the remaining 125 cases are pending.
   Update on contact tracing for confirmed cases
   15.             Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.
   16.             As of 12 February 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 1,090 close contacts. Of the 984 who are still in Singapore, 961 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 23 close contacts.
   Health advisory
   17.             Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.
   18.             All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.
   19.             Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:
   o  Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;
   o  Observe good personal hygiene;
   o  Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
   o  Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;
   o  Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
   o  Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.
   20.             MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
