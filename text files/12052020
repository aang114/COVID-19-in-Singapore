12th May 2020

        As of 12 May 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 884 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
   a) Imported cases: 0
   There are no imported cases today.
   b) Cases in the community: 4 (3 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1 Work Pass)
   The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 8 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.
   c) Work Permit holders (residing outside dormitories): 3
   The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside dormitories has decreased, from an average of 7 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 6 per day in the past week.
   d) Work Permit holders (residing in dormitories): 877
   The number of new cases from the testing of workers with acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms and their contacts remains stable.  But the number of daily cases continues to rise as we are also testing the workers who are well and asymptomatic, as part of our process to verify and test the status of every worker. We had started this intensive testing at the purpose-built dormitories, and are now doing so for the factory-converted dormitories.
   2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOH's daily situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to [47]Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
   3.     Of the new cases, 98% are linked to known clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
   Links between previous cases found
   4.    In the past week (5 May to 11 May), MOH has uncovered links for 93 previously unlinked cases.
   5.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer to [48]Annex B and [49]Annex C for details.
