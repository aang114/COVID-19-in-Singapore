                 24 more cases^[1] of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 344 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.

   2.            As of 6 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 66 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, of which one is imported and 65 are local cases. Among the local cases, we have established links to existing clusters for 35 cases, of which 24 cases were linked to clusters at foreign worker dormitories and 11 were linked to non-dormitory clusters. Contact tracing is ongoing for the remaining 30 cases.

   PCF Sparkletots Preschool @ Fengshan

   4.            Further epidemiological investigations have uncovered a link between the PCF Sparkletots Preschool @ Fengshan Blk 126 cluster to a family member of Case 601. The cluster, with 27 confirmed cases^[5],^ consisted of a family cluster of 11 cases^[6] who are family members of Case 601. With the assistance of the Singapore Police Force, our investigations revealed that Case 566 had travelled to Malaysia on 4 March and was likely infected there. She subsequently transmitted the infection to other family members, including Case 601. The rest of the affected staff members of the preschool likely became infected by Case 601 through a staff meeting.

   5.            Among the 66 cases announced yesterday that were pending contact tracing, our investigations have established links for 22 of the cases, and further investigations are ongoing.

   6.            Contact tracing is underway for unlinked cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to affected countries or regions.

   7.           Please refer to the [47]Annex for a summary of the confirmed cases, and the MOH website for the situation report ([48]www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).

   Cases from public healthcare sector

   Case 1322

   8.            Case 1322 is a 27 year-old female Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to affected countries or regions. She reported onset of symptoms on 30 March, and subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 5 April. She is currently warded in an isolation room at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital.

   9.            Prior to hospital admission, she had gone to work as a patient therapy associate at the Institute of Mental Health.


   Update on condition of confirmed cases

   10.          To date, a total of 344 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.

   11.          Of the 571 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving. 25 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 454 cases who are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19 are isolated and cared for at Concord International Hospital, Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Gleneagles Hospital and the Community Isolation Facility at D'Resort NTUC. Six have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.


   Update on contact tracing for confirmed cases

   12.          Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.

   13.          As of 6 April 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 17,613 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 5,618 are currently quarantined, and 11,995 have completed their quarantine.
