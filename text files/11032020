   2.             As of 11 March 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified 12 more cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. Of these:
   ·      One (Case 174) is part of the cluster involving the private dinner function at SAFRA Jurong on 15 February;
   ·      Eight are imported cases (Cases 169, 170, 171, 173, 175, 176, 177 and 178);

   ·      Two are currently unlinked (Cases 168 and 172).
   Links between previous cases found
   3.             Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.
   a)        Eight of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33, 38, 83, 90, 91, 138 and 151), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore. These cases are linked to another 23 confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81, 84, 88) who are linked to the Grace Assembly of God.
   b)        Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.
   c)         14 of the confirmed cases (Cases 93, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 108 and 110) are linked to Wizlearn Technologies Pte Ltd.
   d)        40 of the confirmed cases (Cases 94, 96, 107, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120, 121, 122, 125, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 133, 134, 137, 139, 140, 142, 144, 145, 146, 148, 149, 150, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 164, 166 and 174) are linked to a private dinner function at SAFRA Jurong on 15 February.
   e)        Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 142, 162 and 163) are linked to boulder+ Gym (12 Kallang Avenue).
   4.             Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition to the clusters, our investigations have identified the following links between cases:
   ·      Case 72 is linked to Cases 59 and 79;
   ·      Case 50 is linked to Cases 55, 65 and 77;
   ·      Case 75 is linked to Case 41;
   ·      Case 86 is linked to Case 82;
   ·      Case 126 is linked to Case 109;
   ·      Case 143 is linked to Case 132; and
   ·      Case 167 is linked to Case 178.

   5.             Contact tracing is underway for the other ten locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to affected countries or regions.

   Health advisory
   37.            Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to mainland China, Iran, northern Italy, Japan and the Republic of Korea.
   38.            All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.
   39.          Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:
   ·      Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;
   ·      Observe good personal hygiene;
   ·      Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
   ·      Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;
   ·      Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
   ·      Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.
   40.          MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
