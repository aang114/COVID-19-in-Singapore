30th Apr 2020

   1.     As of 30 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 528 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
    1. Imported cases: 0
       There are no imported cases today.
    2. Cases in the community: 9 (6 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 3 Work Passes)
       The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 25 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 14 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased, from an average of 17 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per day in the past week.We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.
    3. Work Permit holders (residing outside dormitories): 31
       There is an increase today in the number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside dormitories. The vast majority of these cases are workers in the construction sector serving their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) requirements.  Based on weekly averages, the number has decreased, from an average of 29 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 19 per day in the past week.
    4. Work Permit holders (residing in dormitories): 488

   The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of extensive testing. Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being monitored in the community isolation facilities or general ward of our hospitals. Three are in the intensive care unit (ICU) [1].

   2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOH's daily situation Report ([47]www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to [48]Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

   3.     Of the new cases, 85% are linked to known clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.

   Links between previous cases found

   4.     In the past week (23 April to 29 April), MOH has uncovered links for 1,066 previously unlinked cases.

   5.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer to [49]Annex B for details.

   Update on condition of confirmed cases
   6.     56 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 1,244 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.

   7.     There are currently 1,708 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 22 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 13,202 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 15 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.

   8.     Case 703, a 58 year-old female Singapore Citizen, has passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection on 30 April 2020. She was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 26 March. Ng Teng Fong General Hospital has reached out to her family and is extending assistance to them.
