9th Mar 2020

   1. Three more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospital (Cases 112, 138 and 151). In all, 93 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital.
   2. As of 9 March 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified 10 more cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. Of these:
   o Six are part of the cluster involving a private dinner function at SAFRA Jurong (333 Boon Lay Way) on 15 February;
   o One is linked to the cluster at The Life Church and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road); and
   o Three are imported cases.
   Links between previous cases found
   3. Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.
   a) Eight of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33, 38, 83, 90, 91, 138 and 151), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore. These cases are linked to another 23 confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81, 84, 88) who are linked to the Grace Assembly of God.
   b) Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34 and 40) are linked to Yong Thai Hang.
   c) Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to the business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22 January.
   d) Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.
   e) 14 of the confirmed cases (Cases 93, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 108 and 110) are linked to Wizlearn Technologies Pte Ltd.
   f) 36 of the confirmed cases (Cases 94, 96, 107, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120, 121, 122, 125, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 133, 134, 137, 139, 140, 142, 144, 145, 146, 148, 149, 150, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159 and 160) are linked to a private dinner function at SAFRA Jurong on 15 February.
   4. Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition to the clusters, our investigations have identified the following links between cases:
   o Case 44 is linked to Cases 13 and 26;
   o Case 72 is linked to Cases 59 and 79;
   o Case 50 is linked to Cases 55, 65 and 77;
   o Case 75 is linked to Case 41;
   o Case 86 is linked to Case 82;
   o Case 126 is linked to Case 109; and
   o Case 143 is linked to Case 132.
   5. Contact tracing is underway for the other 14 locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to affected countries or regions.
   Prioritisation of resources at public hospitals
   6. In view of the rising number of COVID-19 infections globally, and the expected rise in the number of confirmed cases in Singapore, we will need to prioritise the resources at our public hospitals.
   7. From 7 March 2020, foreigners who are short-term visit pass holders (STVP) who seek treatment for COVID-19 in Singapore will need to pay for their treatment. MOH will continue to waive COVID-19 testing fees for all STVP holders as part of our public health measures to identify and initiate contact tracing for confirmed cases who may have been infectious while in Singapore.
   8. The government will continue to pay for the COVID-19 testing fees and hospital bill in full for Singapore Residents and long term pass holders who are admitted to public hospitals for COVID-19.

Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.
   47. Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:
   o Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;
   o Observe good personal hygiene;
   o Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
   o Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;
   o Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
   o Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.
   48. MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
