   3.            Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition to the clusters, our investigations have identified the following links between cases:

   ·         Case 221 is linked to Case 204.

   4.            Contact tracing is underway for the other 11 locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to affected countries or regions.

   Health advisory
   57.         Singaporeans are advised to defer all non-essential travel abroad.

   58.         All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.

   59.         Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:

   ·         Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness; ·         Observe good personal hygiene;
   ·         Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
   ·         Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;
   ·         Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
   ·         Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

   61.         MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
