15th Feb 2020

   One more case of COVID-19 infection has been discharged from hospital today (Case 24). In all, 18 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital.

   2.              As of 15 February 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified five additional cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. Of these, three are linked to the cluster at Grace Assembly of God, one is linked to the cluster at Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site and the other case is linked to a previous case.


   Links between previous cases found

   3.              Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.

        a) Cases 8 and 9, as well as Cases 31, 33 and 38, are linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road). This is a possible cluster involving five cases (Cases 8, 9, 31, 33 and 38).

        b) Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34 and 40) are linked to the cluster associated with Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road).

        c) Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to the private business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22 January.

        d) Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.

        e) Sixteen of the confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70 and 71) are linked to the Grace Assembly of God.

   Investigations on these clusters are ongoing.

   4.              Contact tracing is underway for the other eight locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China. Case 44 was a contact of Cases 13 and 26. Case 65 is linked to Cases 50 and 55. Case 59 is linked to Case 72.


   About the confirmed cases

   5.              MOH has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the following cases who were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 15 February morning.

In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.

   25.           As of 15 February 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 2,093 close contacts. Of the 1,959 who are still in Singapore, 1,697 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 262 close contacts.


   Health advisory

   26.           Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.

   27.           All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.

   28.           Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:
     * Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;
     * Observe good personal hygiene;
     * Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
     * Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;
     * Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
     * Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

   29.           MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
