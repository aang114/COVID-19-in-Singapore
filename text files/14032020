If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.
   64. Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:
   o    Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;
   o    Observe good personal hygiene;
   o    Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
   o    Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;
