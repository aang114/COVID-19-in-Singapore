                   Two more confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospital today (Cases 30 and 45). In all, 17 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital.
   2.            As of 14 February 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified nine additional cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. Of these, six are linked to the cluster at Grace Assembly of God and one is linked to a previous case. Contact tracing of the other two cases is underway to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to China.

   Links between previous cases found

   3.             Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.
     * Cases 8 and 9, as well as Cases 31, 33 and 38, are linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road). This is a possible cluster involving five cases (Cases 8, 9, 31, 33 and 38).
     * Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34 and 40) are linked to the cluster associated with Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road).
     * Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to the private business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22 January.
     * Four of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52 and 56) are linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.
     * Thirteen of the confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57 and 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67) are linked to the Grace Assembly of God.

   Investigations on these clusters are ongoing.

   4.        Contact tracing is underway for the other nine locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China. Case 44 was a contact of Cases 13 and 26. Case 65 is linked to Cases 50 and 55.

   Health advisory
   37.         Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.

   38.          All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.

   39.         Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:

     * Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;
     * Observe good personal hygiene;
     * Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating,
     * after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
     * Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;
     * Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
     * Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

   40.          MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
