26th Apr 2020

                   As of 26 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 931 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
   a)   Imported cases: 2
   There are 2 imported cases today. Both are Singaporeans who had been placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore on 10 April.
   b)   Cases in the community: 18 (13 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 5 Work Passes)
   The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 31 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 21 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased, from an average of 21 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 14 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.
   c)   Work Permit holders (residing outside dormitories): 25
   The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside dormitories has continued to increase, from an average of 20 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 26 per day in the past week.
   d)   Work Permit holders (residing in dormitories): 886
   The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of extensive testing. Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being monitored in the community isolation facilities or general ward of our hospitals. None of them is in the intensive care unit.
   2.             Details of these trends can be found in MOH's daily situation Report ([47]www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to [48]Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
   3.             Of the new cases, 74% are linked to known clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
   4.             MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to Singapore Cricket Club (A Connaught Drive) and The Wedding Brocade (1 Yishun Industrial Street 1) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now been closed.
   Links between previous cases found
   5.             In the past week (19 April to 25 April), MOH has uncovered links for 1,280 previously unlinked cases.
   6.             Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer to [49]Annex B for details.
   Update on condition of confirmed cases
   7.             58 more cases^[1] of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 1,060 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
   8.             There are currently 1,311 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 22 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 11,241 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 12 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
