21st Apr 2020

        As of 21 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 1,111 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
   a) Imported cases: 0
   There are no imported cases today.
   b) Cases in the community: 28 (20 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 8 Work/ Long Term Passes)
   The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 39 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 28 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has decreased slightly, from an average of 21 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 20 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.
   c) Work Permit holders (residing outside dormitories): 33
   The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside dormitories has continued to increase, from an average of 14 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 26 per day in the past week.
   d) Work Permit holders (residing in dormitories): 1,050
   The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of extensive testing. Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being monitored in the community isolation facilities or general ward of our hospitals. None of them is in the intensive care unit.
   2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH's daily situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to [47]Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
   3.   Of the new cases, 66% are linked to known clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
   Links between previous cases found
   4.    In the past week (14 April to 20 April), MOH has uncovered links for 672 previously unlinked cases.
   5.    Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer to [48]Annex B for details.
   Update on condition of confirmed cases
   6.     38 more cases ^[1] of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 825 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
   7.    Of the 3,593 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving. 27 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 4,682 cases who are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. 11 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
